# Welcome to TIKR Repo! 

- The Purpose of this Repo is to enable some experience with a MLE pipeline and improve my skill with git and the front end development! 
- Scaling TIKR will be great experience but alos bootstrapping the knowledge into the other personal projects would be great.

- Finally, all testing code before implementation will be made in the ML-Projects Repo under Stock_Project folder :D 

Enjoy!

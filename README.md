Live web app front end hosted by **GitHub Pages** : **https://nhowley72.github.io/TIKR/**

**TIKR** is a Web App and MLE project where you can predict the future value of stocks based on Machine Learning. 

This Repo is a fun project where I mess around launching a web app using Render, Vercel, React, Python, HTML, JavaScript, tensorflow, and a few bespoke Machine Learning Engineering best practices (in time). 

##Â Technical bit:
- FastAPI : https://tikr-ezii.onrender.com/docs#/default/predict_predict_post
- **Backend** hosted on render : https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-cue05qlsvqrc73d2fuig/deploys/dep-cue19123esus73ddhbig
- **Frontend** hosted on 
    - GitPages : https://nhowley72.github.io/TIKR/
    - vercel : https://nhowley72.github.io/TIKR/


### Applying changes to the web app
- commit and sync changes to github. 
- manually run render https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-cue05qlsvqrc73d2fuig/deploys/dep-cue19123esus73ddhbig

Extra step for vercel hosting: 
- in vscode run vercel (takes 3 seconds) (this even needed?)
    - cd my-react-app/backend
    - vercel 
- done.

## Final Legacy Comments
- The Purpose of this Repo is to enable some experience with a MLE pipeline and improve my skill with git and the front end development! 
- Scaling TIKR will be great experience but also bootstrapping the knowledge into the other personal projects would be great.

- Finally, all testing code before implementation will be made in the ML-Projects Repo under Stock_Project folder :D 

Enjoy!
